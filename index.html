                    <h1 class="sub-title">About Me</h1>
                    <p>I've been in love with tech for as long as I can remember. 
                        From a young age, I was always tinkering with gadgets and trying to understand how things worked, 
                        which naturally led me to software development.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Today, I’m a full-stack web developer with a passion for creating websites and mobile apps 
                        that are not only functional but also user-friendly and visually appealing.
                        <br>
                        <br>I’ve honed my skills in technologies like React, Node.js, Express, and various databases, including both SQL and NoSQL, giving me the flexibility to build end-to-end solutions.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        What excites me most about development is the endless opportunity to learn and innovate.
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        I love taking on new challenges, whether it’s designing a sleek user interface or building a robust back-end system.
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        My goal is always to bring ideas to life with clean, efficient code while ensuring that the end-user experience is seamless.
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        Tech has been my passion for as long as I can remember, and it continues to fuel my curiosity and drive to push the limits of what’s possible.
                        It’s not just about writing code for me—it’s about solving real-world problems and making a positive impact through technology.</p>

                        <h3>Concise News</h3>
                        <p>I built an app called Concise because I wanted to make staying informed feel a little less overwhelming. With Concise, I organized the news into categories, so you can easily find the topics that interest you most. Every evening, the app updates with the top 10 stories in each category, giving you the freshest news in a simple, straightforward way. 
                            No endless scrolling, just the most important headlines, neatly packaged to save you time and keep you up to date.</p>

                        <p>I built a social media app specifically for university campuses to help students stay informed and connected. 
                            The app keeps students updated on campus events, so they never miss out on important happenings. 
                            It also allows them to connect with alumni, creating a bridge between current students and graduates, 
                            fostering a sense of community and offering valuable networking opportunities. 
                            It’s designed to make campus life more interactive and ensure everyone feels involved, both during their time at university and beyond.</p>
